# Adventure-Game-Java
My Portfolio Piece from my first year project at uni at MMU where I received 94%, worth 30 credits

## Aim
The project involved creating a game using Java and the Processing framework. The game incorporates various programming concepts and skills learned during the course, such as object-oriented programming, event handling, animation, and user interaction.

### Features of the Game

- **Object-Oriented Design:** Utilizes classes and objects to encapsulate game entities and logic. Mainily through Classes & Polymorphism.
- **Animation:** Smooth animations for game characters and environment.
- **User Interaction:** Responds to user inputs for controlling game actions.
- **Game Mechanics:** Includes scoring, levels, and game-over conditions.


## Technologies Used

- **Java:** The primary programming language used for the project.
- **Processing:** A flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following structure:
